# HSBC-Bank-Personal-Loan-Acceptance-Analysis
Welcome to the HSBC Bank Personal Loan Acceptance Analysis and Marketing Optimization project repository. In this project, we aim to use data insights to make personal loan marketing campaigns work better and smarter.

# Data
The dataset contains customer details such as ID, name, gender, and age, among other information. The project's objective is to derive valuable insights from this data to develop targeted marketing strategies.

# Analysis
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I undertook exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset from the HSBC Bank. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, I explored relationships between different variables and identified potential factors influencing loan acceptance rates and marketing effectiveness.
  
2. **Data Analysis Techniques**: I employed Excel extensively for data analysis, utilizing features such as pivot tables and graphs to gain insights from the dataset.

3. **Insights**: I investigated factors such as customer demographics, past interaction history, and response rates to previous campaigns to inform the marketing team's strategy for the next campaign.

# Conclusion
Targeting Potential Customers: The main criterion for targeting potential loan customers is an annual income of $100K or more, with 91% of previous loan recipients falling into this category. Additionally, refined criteria include individuals without a TD account, those with internet banking, and those in professional occupations. By incorporating these criteria, future campaigns can be tailored to a more precise audience, increasing the likelihood of success.
